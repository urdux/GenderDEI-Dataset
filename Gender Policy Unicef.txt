UNICEF Gender Policy 2021-2030
 
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) 
established its first Gender Policy in 2010, as 
the global community was advancing a more 
progressive normative framework around gender 
equality and the empowerment of girls and women. 
In the decade since, there has been notable progress, 
attributable to more deliberate investments in improving 
the lives and well-being of girls and women. Change has 
not been far-reaching enough, however, and significant 
hurdles remain, as gender discrimination, perpetuated 
through laws, policies, norms, and practices, continues to 
restrict girls’, women’s and other groups’ decision-making 
power and limit their potential. Furthermore, the global 
impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic, climate change, conflict, and other crises have 
highlighted how fragile gender equality gains truly are, 
threatening rollbacks to progress in many areas, from 
education and health to employment, food security, and 
protection from violence.
Looking towards 2030, UNICEF is issuing a new Gender 
Policy, which reflects current realities and the evolving 
gender equality landscape. Aligned to the Sustainable 
Development Goals and United Nations Reform, this Policy 
commits UNICEF to a bolder and more ambitious vision for gender equality and the empowerment of all children, 
adolescents, and women. It mandates that UNICEF go 
beyond simply responding to the manifestations of inequality, 
and instead work actively to remove the underlying structural 
barriers – such as harmful social norms and gendered power 
systems – that perpetuate inequalities. This transformative, 
values-based approach, which simultaneously empowers 
disadvantaged children, adolescents and women, positions 
gender equality as fundamental to child rights and seeks to 
chart a clear path towards a more just, equitable, empathetic, 
and inclusive world for all. This Policy places a special 
emphasis on promoting the leadership and wellbeing of girls 
and women, recognizing that they continue to bear the brunt 
of multiple intersecting deprivations.The Policy highlights the history, vision, and 
strategic comparative advantages of UNICEF related 
to gender equality and articulates the commitment 
of the organization to achieving its vision through 
strategic partnerships, amplified investments in 
transformative programmes and policies, and, 
importantly, improving the ways in which UNICEF 
conducts its work. This commitment is further 
operationalized in a Gender Action Plan , which 
describes the concrete steps UNICEF will take 
to centre gender equality and the empowerment 
of girls and women, while supporting, and even 
leading, the global community toward a more 
equitable world for all.

Introduction 
UNICEF has long embraced and prioritized 
gender equality and women’s and girls’ 
empowerment not only as core principles and 
practices, but as essential to the realization of 
the human rights of all children. Gender discrimination 
can start even before birth and impede the realization 
of rights across every stage of life - through infancy, 
childhood and adolescence, and beyond. 
As the United Nations agency mandated to protect and 
promote the rights and opportunities of children and 
adolescents – at a stage of life when gender norms are 
learned and solidified – UNICEF has a unique responsibility 
to ensure that gender equality is at the core of everything 
it does. These commitments and responsibilities are 
rooted in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and were strengthened 
significantly in the 1990s, with the Plan of Action from the 
International Conference on Population and Development, 
the Beijing Platform for Action from the Fourth World 
Conference on Women and their follow-on agreements. 
The first official Gender Policy of UNICEF, issued in 2010, 
included broad aspirations and commitments, as well as 
practical applications for the agency. The first UNICEF 
Gender Action Plan (2014-2017) furthered the Gender 
Policy by laying out specific guidance for programming, 
institutional effectiveness, and reporting on and assessing 
progress toward gender equality and women’s and girls’ 
empowerment. The second Gender Action Plan (2018-
2021) built on growing global commitments to gender equality – including as described in the Sustainable 
Development Goals – to emphasize the importance of 
gender equality and girls’ and women’s empowerment in 
all sectors and contexts where UNICEF works. 
Now, with gender equality widely understood as central to 
the success of the Sustainable Development Goals and to 
the efforts of all United Nations agencies, the time has come 
to issue a new Gender Policy for UNICEF that reflects the 
lived realities of those we serve. This new Policy builds on 
the important foundations established through the previous 
Gender Action Plans and is grounded in human rights-
based approaches and development system reforms. It is 
closely aligned to the United Nations System-wide Action 
Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women 
(UN-SWAP) and commitments that UNICEF has made 
this Policy commits  
UNICEF to a bolder and 
more ambitious vision for 
gender equality and the 
empowerment of all children, 
adolescents, and women.

as part of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Gender 
Accountability Framework and the Core Commitments for 
Children in Humanitarian Action, among others. 
UNICEF recognizes that gender norms and expectations 
impact all children and women, and that girls, as well as 
children of diverse genders, are at disproportionate risk of 
gender-based discrimination, rights violations, and denial of 
full access to resources and opportunities. A specific focus 
on these individuals and populations is therefore necessary 
to advance their rights and wellbeing, and to achieve the 
broader vision of a more equitable world demanded by 
the Sustainable Development Goals. Simultaneously, 
UNICEF recognizes the need to address gender holistically, 
including through the ways in which it intersects with 
other dimensions of children’s and adolescents’ lives. 
This includes addressing its linkages with race, ethnicity, 
sexuality, disability, gender identity, and other critical 
factors. It also requires adopting approaches that promote 
positive masculinities and non-violent behaviours, and that 
engage boys and men in actively working to achieve a 
gender-equal world, where all will benefit. 
Changes in discriminatory and harmful norms, behaviours, 
and power structures cannot happen overnight, but 
progress seen in recent decades toward increasing girls’ 
primary educational attainment, sexual and reproductive 
health and rights, and reducing instances of child marriage 
and early unions, for example, demonstrate that such 
change is possible. At the same time, the escalation of 
harms to girls, women, and marginalized groups, as well as 
the disproportionate and potentially lasting impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, point to just how fragile these gains 
may be, and why a commitment to structural, societal, and 
institutional change is necessary to sustain progress.Vision:  
The World We 
Work For 
UNICEF works for a world in which all nations, 
institutions, communities, families, and individuals 
value and care for children and adolescents of 
all gender identities, gender expressions, sexual 
orientations, and sex characteristics as equals; and where 
countries not only prioritize investments to promote and 
protect the rights of all children, adolescents, and women, but also actively work to transform harmful gender norms; 
mitigate the impacts of harmful masculinities on all 
children and adolescents; promote equality in relationships, 
opportunities, and power structures; and support the 
development of all children, adolescents, and women to 
their fullest potential. 
To this end:
WE 
STRIVEfor a world that has eliminated and healed from 
the generational legacies of discrimination  of all 
kinds, including on the basis of sex, age, 
religion, race, ethnicity, health, economic status, 
occupation, class, caste, citizenship, national origin, 
immigration status, sexual identity or orientation, gender 
identity or expression, disability, and urban/rural locality, 

or other status, and in which intersecting effects of 
systems of oppression on the basis of these and other 
identities and characteristics no longer exist.
WE  
AIMto support meaningful and diverse partnerships 
with governments and others that promote 
children’s and adolescents’ ability to access 
their fundamental human rights, including their rights to 
learn, to adequate health and nutrition, to clean water and 
quality sanitation, to  poverty, to sexual and reproductive 
health and rights, to fully and meaningfully participate in 
their communities, to influence and lead social change, 
and to contribute to sustainable development and healthy, 
green, and secure futures. 
WE 
STRIVEfor a world in which all children and adolescents 
grow up in peaceful and just societies, free 
from the experience or threat of violence and 
harmful practices in all settings, including, among others, 
gender-based violence, neglect, exploitation, child 
marriage, female genital mutilation, and violence 
experienced in and outside the home, and in online 
spaces, among others. 
WE  
AIMto support parents, families, and communities to 
gain the resources they need to support children 
and adolescents through healthy and gender-
equitable life course transitions, from infancy to adulthood, 
and to establish positive norms and social structures based 
on shared values of equality, justice, and human rights. 
WE 
STRIVEfor a world where all children and adolescents 
are protected, encouraged, supported, and have 
access to the education and information they 
need to understand, speak, and act on their own truths.
WE  
AIMto close gendered divides in access to 
education, employment, and technology; and 
to ensure that all children and adolescents 
benefit from and drive innovations and new pathways to 
learning and interacting. 
WE 
STRIVEfor a world where all children are protected 
against the gendered impacts of poverty, 
economic discrimination, climate insecurity, 
water scarcity, crisis and conflict, and social exclusion 
throughout their lives. 
WE  
AIMto create a world where children, adolescents, 
and adults co-create and model new and more 
equitable systems of power; where all children 
and adolescents - and especially girls - claim their equal 
right to wellbeing, fulfilment, and contribution to 
sustainable development; and where girls and women 
are recognized and supported as leaders, innovators, 
change-makers, and problem-solvers, thereby securing 
the foundations of civil and political liberties during their 
lives and through future generations.

Added Value, 
Strategic and 
Comparative 
Advantage 
of UNICEF
With visibility, public trust, and credibility 
generated through 75 years of 
experience and achievements in close 
collaboration with governments and 
other partners; presence and operational capacity in 
190 countries across the humanitarian, peace-building, 
and development nexus; long-standing strategic 
partnerships, from the grassroots to the global levels; 
experience in norms change, including advocating for 
systems-level changes, and scaling up effective and 
evidence-based programming; and a demonstrated 
capacity to work across sectors and the life course, 
UNICEF strives to be a leader and collaborator 
within the United Nations system and a model for 
the global community in advancing transformational 
change toward gender equality. We are committed to 
advancing this change in several key areas where we 
have particular strengths and added value, including 
the following:Partnerships
Recognizing the importance of diverse partnerships, 
UNICEF will use its unique ability to convene and engage 
partners at all levels to advance gender equality. In addition 
to national and subnational governments, UNICEF will 
strengthen and expand its relationships with civil society and 
non-governmental organizations, bilateral and multilateral 
partners, donors, academic and research institutions, 
the private sector, and the media, as well as children 
and adolescents, to advocate for policies and practices 
that support gender equality across all of its goals and 
maximise impact. This includes leveraging relationships with 
governments to advocate for transformative budgeting and 
dedicated financing at the country level to ensure resources 
are allocated toward the advancement of gender equality. It 
also entails expanding partnerships with, and the meaningful 
engagement of, girl-led, youth-led, and women-led feminist 
and rights-based organizations and networks. 
Adolescent girls
In close partnership with the United Nations system, 
including its sister agencies UN Women, the United 
Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations 
Population Fund, and through engaging adolescents 
and young people, UNICEF has already demonstrated a 
capacity to generate results at scale to promote gender 
equality, including advancing adolescent girls’ wellbeing. 
UNICEF will continue to confront the persistent and 
interrelated inequalities that adolescent girls face and will 
promote the importance of investing in girls to ensure 
empowered future generations of women. UNICEF will 
also continue to invest in empowerment approaches that 
are girl-centred, and that intentionally create spaces for girls 
to lead, innovate, develop, and own solutions. Positive gender socialization
UNICEF has a comparative advantage and mandate to 
support the development and expansion of positive, 
equitable norms during childhood and adolescence, 
when gender identities, norms, expressions, and 
discriminations are shaped, learned, and amplified. 
UNICEF will expand on its considerable capacity and 
experience in the work of social norm change by 
engaging parents, caregivers, community leaders, and 
boys and men as active partners, and allies for gender 
equality; and by promoting gender-equitable policies and 
services. Incorporating norms change into work on early 
childhood development and education, for example, can 
simultaneously increase childcare options, decrease 
the burden of unpaid care work which women and girls 
disproportionately shoulder, and expand more gender-
equitable involvement of men and boys. UNICEF recognizes 
that gender norms and 
expectations impact all children 
and women, and that girls, as well 
as children of diverse genders, are at 
disproportionate risk of gender-based 
discrimination, rights violations, 
and denial of full access to 
resources and opportunities.
Gender equality in humanitarian action
The mandate for and ongoing commitment of UNICEF to 
the protection and support of children and adolescents 
in crisis and humanitarian contexts also brings a crucial 
responsibility for ensuring that its work in emergency 
preparedness, disaster risk reduction, and crisis 
response is increasingly gender-transformative in 
its approach. Aligned to the Core Commitments for 
Children in Humanitarian Action, UNICEF will act to 
address gender-based violence in emergency settings 
and beyond; ensure that programmes delivered in these 
settings are consistently informed by gender analyses, 
evidence and data; and prioritize the meaningful 
participation of girls and women.
Institutional 
Transformation 
For Gender 
Equality
UNICEF believes that both the achievement 
of gender equality and the empowerment of 
all girls and women are paramount in their 
own right, as well as essential contributors 
to, and central elements of, inclusive and sustainable 
development and our vision of a more equitable world. As we endeavour to achieve this vision, we 
must continue our own internal transformation toward 
becoming a more gender-equal institution. Continued 
integration of gender equality across the agency and 
its programmes requires dedicated attention and 
resources to build gender capacity; to embed gender 
expertise; to collect and analyse data in ways that 
improve the understanding and tracking of gender 
dimensions; and to increase understanding of the 
importance of gender equality across all goal areas  
at UNICEF. Our culture and the ways in which UNICEF works, 
including our processes and procedures, must exemplify 
the principles we envision and for which we strive. 
We thus commit to being a gender-transformative 
organization that invests the appropriate 
resources in developing the capacity of staff, 
and that invests in partners and programmes to 
deliver more gender-equitable results, as well as 
in organizational structures and processes that 
hold us accountable to our commitments . 

A gender-transformative UNICEF requires:
Zero tolerance within our organization and amongst 
our partners for discrimination, sexual exploitation, 
abuse, and harassment. This includes a responsibility 
to promote child safeguarding, to create and maintain 
an environment that prevents exploitation and abuse, 
and to provide timely, confidential, and effective 
investigation, assistance, and support to survivors; 

Ending discrimination for all as the responsibility 
of everyone at UNICEF, regardless of their role, 
title, or position, as well as the active participation 
of everyone at UNICEF in eliminating internalized 
gender bias and in promoting gender equality and 
the empowerment of girls and women;

Accountability for results at the highest levels, including 
explicit compliance mechanisms for senior managers 
across the agency on gender equality priorities and 
results, dedicated annual reporting to the Executive 
Board and UN-SWAP, and mechanisms at global, 
regional, and country levels to oversee implementation; Achieving parity at all levels, including through 
addressing barriers to recruitment, retention, and 
career mobility for female staff and ensuring equal 
career opportunities for women, men, and persons 
of all genders in UNICEF; ÇAllocating sufficient human and financial resources 
for programming, advocacy, communications, 
learning, and management that connect to gender 
results, including available and adequately funded 
technical expertise to guide the organization’s global 
gender equality efforts;

Attaining the highest level of financial accountability 
to meet our commitments, with ongoing monitoring 
to ensure that minimum standards are consistently 
exceeded, above and beyond benchmarks provided 
by the UN-SWAP;Working in partnership across sectors to apply gender-equitable values and practices, both to 
UNICEF-led programmes and to our work with 
governments, other multilateral agencies, funders, 
and other partners;

Establishing standards that provide sufficient 
support and resources to expand core gender-
technical expertise, not only to provide institutional 
guidance, but also to support and advocate with our 
partners to advance in their own journeys towards 
gender equality; 

Continual organizational learning and growth 
through regularly commissioned independent 
evaluations of our work on gender equality, as well 
as investment in a robust and rigorous research 
agenda that informs and promotes innovative and 
evidence-based programming priorities, policy 
change, and practices, and that contributes to the 
global marketplace of ideas. 
 
This Gender Policy embeds gender equality as an 
essential element of the mandate of UNICEF to 
promote the realization of equal rights for all children. 
In tandem with the Gender Action Plan, it provides a 
framework and roadmap for UNICEF to operationalize 
these principles to deliver real and lasting results for all 
children, adolescents, and women.

Introduction 
UNICEF has long embraced and prioritized 

gender equality and women’s and girls’ 
empowerment not only as core principles and 
practices, but as essential to the realization of 
the human rights of all children. Gender discrimination 
can start even before birth and impede the realization 
of rights across every stage of life - through infancy, 
childhood and adolescence, and beyond. 

As the United Nations agency mandated to protect and 
promote the rights and opportunities of children and 
adolescents – at a stage of life when gender norms are 
learned and solidified – UNICEF has a unique responsibility 
to ensure that gender equality is at the core of everything 
it does. These commitments and responsibilities are 
rooted in the Convention on the Rights of the Child 


and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and were strengthened 
significantly in the 1990s, with the Plan of Action from the 
International Conference on Population and Development, 
the Beijing Platform for Action from the Fourth World 
Conference on Women and their follow-on agreements. 

The first official Gender Policy of UNICEF, issued in 2010, 
included broad aspirations and commitments, as well as 
practical applications for the agency. The first UNICEF 
Gender Action Plan (2014-2017) furthered the Gender 
Policy by laying out specific guidance for programming, 
institutional effectiveness, and reporting on and assessing 
progress toward gender equality and women’s and girls’ 
empowerment. The second Gender Action Plan (2018-
2021) built on growing global commitments to gender 

equality – including as described in the Sustainable 
Development Goals – to emphasize the importance of 
gender equality and girls’ and women’s empowerment in 
all sectors and contexts where UNICEF works. 

Now, with gender equality widely understood as central to 
the success of the Sustainable Development Goals and to 
the efforts of all United Nations agencies, the time has come 
to issue a new Gender Policy for UNICEF that reflects the 
lived realities of those we serve. This new Policy builds on 
the important foundations established through the previous 
Gender Action Plans and is grounded in human rights-
based approaches and development system reforms. It is 
closely aligned to the United Nations System-wide Action 
Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women 
(UN-SWAP) and commitments that UNICEF has made 

as part of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Gender 
Accountability Framework and the Core Commitments for 
Children in Humanitarian Action, among others. 

UNICEF recognizes that gender norms and expectations 
impact all children and women, and that girls, as well as 
children of diverse genders, are at disproportionate risk of 
gender-based discrimination, rights violations, and denial of 
full access to resources and opportunities. A specific focus 
on these individuals and populations is therefore necessary 
to advance their rights and wellbeing, and to achieve the 
broader vision of a more equitable world demanded by 
the Sustainable Development Goals. Simultaneously, 
UNICEF recognizes the need to address gender holistically, 
including through the ways in which it intersects with 
other dimensions of children’s and adolescents’ lives. 
This includes addressing its linkages with race, ethnicity, 
sexuality, disability, gender identity, and other critical 
factors. It also requires adopting approaches that promote 
positive masculinities and non-violent behaviours, and that 
engage boys and men in actively working to achieve a 
gender-equal world, where all will benefit. 

Changes in discriminatory and harmful norms, behaviours, 
and power structures cannot happen overnight, but 
progress seen in recent decades toward increasing girls’ 
primary educational attainment, sexual and reproductive 
health and rights, and reducing instances of child marriage 
and early unions, for example, demonstrate that such 
change is possible. At the same time, the escalation of 
harms to girls, women, and marginalized groups, as well as 
the disproportionate and potentially lasting impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, point to just how fragile these gains 
may be, and why a commitment to structural, societal, and 
institutional change is necessary to sustain progress.


Vision:  
The World We 
Work For 

UNICEF works for a world in which all nations, 
institutions, communities, families, and individuals 
value and care for children and adolescents of 
all gender identities, gender expressions, sexual 
orientations, and sex characteristics as equals; and where 
countries not only prioritize investments to promote and 
protect the rights of all children, adolescents, and women,
but also actively work to transform harmful gender norms; 
mitigate the impacts of harmful masculinities on all 
children and adolescents; promote equality in relationships, 
opportunities, and power structures; and support the 
development of all children, adolescents, and women to 
their fullest potential. 

To this end:
WE 
STRIVE
for a world that has eliminated and healed from 
the generational legacies of discrimination of all 
kinds, including on the basis of sex, age, 
religion, race, ethnicity, health, economic status, 
occupation, class, caste, citizenship, national origin, 
immigration status, sexual identity or orientation, gender 
identity or expression, disability, and urban/rural locality, 
or other status, and in which intersecting effects of 
systems of oppression on the basis of these and other 
identities and characteristics no longer exist.

WE  
AIM
to support meaningful and diverse partnerships 
with governments and others that promote 
children’s and adolescents’ ability to access 

their fundamental human rights, including their rights to 
learn, to adequate health and nutrition, to clean water and 
quality sanitation, to  poverty, to sexual and reproductive 
health and rights, to fully and meaningfully participate in 
their communities, to influence and lead social change, 
and to contribute to sustainable development and healthy, 
green, and secure futures. 

WE 
STRIVE
for a world in which all children and adolescents 
grow up in peaceful and just societies, free 
from the experience or threat of violence and 
harmful practices in all settings, including, among others, 
gender-based violence, neglect, exploitation, child 
marriage, female genital mutilation, and violence 
experienced in and outside the home, and in online 
spaces, among others. 

WE  
AIM
to support parents, families, and communities to 
gain the resources they need to support children 
and adolescents through healthy and gender-

right to wellbeing, fulfilment, and contribution to 
sustainable development; and where girls and women 
are recognized and supported as leaders, innovators, 
change-makers, and problem-solvers, thereby securing 
the foundations of civil and political liberties during their 
lives and through future generations.

Added Value, 
Strategic and 
Comparative 
Advantage 
of UNICEF
With visibility, public trust, and credibility 

generated through 75 years of 
experience and achievements in close 
collaboration with governments and 
other partners; presence and operational capacity in 
190 countries across the humanitarian, peace-building, 
and development nexus; long-standing strategic 
partnerships, from the grassroots to the global levels; 
experience in norms change, including advocating for 
systems-level changes, and scaling up effective and 
evidence-based programming; and a demonstrated 
capacity to work across sectors and the life course, 
UNICEF strives to be a leader and collaborator 
within the United Nations system and a model for 
the global community in advancing transformational 
change toward gender equality. We are committed to 
advancing this change in several key areas where we 
have particular strengths and added value, including 
the following:

Partnerships

Recognizing the importance of diverse partnerships, 
UNICEF will use its unique ability to convene and engage 
partners at all levels to advance gender equality. In addition 
to national and subnational governments, UNICEF will 
strengthen and expand its relationships with civil society and 
non-governmental organizations, bilateral and multilateral 
partners, donors, academic and research institutions, 
the private sector, and the media, as well as children 
and adolescents, to advocate for policies and practices 
that support gender equality across all of its goals and 
maximise impact. This includes leveraging relationships with 
governments to advocate for transformative budgeting and 
dedicated financing at the country level to ensure resources 
are allocated toward the advancement of gender equality. It 
also entails expanding partnerships with, and the meaningful 
engagement of, girl-led, youth-led, and women-led feminist 
and rights-based organizations and networks. 

Adolescent girls

In close partnership with the United Nations system, 
including its sister agencies UN Women, the United 
Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations 
Population Fund, and through engaging adolescents 
and young people, UNICEF has already demonstrated a 
capacity to generate results at scale to promote gender 
equality, including advancing adolescent girls’ wellbeing. 
UNICEF will continue to confront the persistent and 
interrelated inequalities that adolescent girls face and will 
promote the importance of investing in girls to ensure 
empowered future generations of women. UNICEF will 
also continue to invest in empowerment approaches that 
are girl-centred, and that intentionally create spaces for girls 
to lead, innovate, develop, and own solutions. 

UNICEF recognizes 
that gender norms and 
expectations impact all children 
and women, and that girls, as well 
as children of diverse genders, are at 
disproportionate risk of gender-based 
discrimination, rights violations, 
and denial of full access to 
resources and opportunities.

Positive gender socialization

UNICEF has a comparative advantage and mandate to 
support the development and expansion of positive, 
equitable norms during childhood and adolescence, 
when gender identities, norms, expressions, and 
discriminations are shaped, learned, and amplified. 
UNICEF will expand on its considerable capacity and 
experience in the work of social norm change by 
engaging parents, caregivers, community leaders, and 
boys and men as active partners, and allies for gender 
equality; and by promoting gender-equitable policies and 
services. Incorporating norms change into work on early 
childhood development and education, for example, can 
simultaneously increase childcare options, decrease 
the burden of unpaid care work which women and girls 
disproportionately shoulder, and expand more gender-
equitable involvement of men and boys. 

Gender equality in humanitarian action
The mandate for and ongoing commitment of UNICEF to 
the protection and support of children and adolescents 
in crisis and humanitarian contexts also brings a crucial 
responsibility for ensuring that its work in emergency 
preparedness, disaster risk reduction, and crisis 
response is increasingly gender-transformative in 
its approach. Aligned to the Core Commitments for 
Children in Humanitarian Action, UNICEF will act to 
address gender-based violence in emergency settings 
and beyond; ensure that programmes delivered in these 
settings are consistently informed by gender analyses, 
evidence and data; and prioritize the meaningful 
participation of girls and women.

Institutional 
Transformation 
For Gender 
Equality
UNICEF believes that both the achievement 
of gender equality and the empowerment of 
all girls and women are paramount in their 
own right, as well as essential contributors
to, and central elements of, inclusive and sustainable 
development and our vision of a more equitable 

world. As we endeavour to achieve this vision, we 
must continue our own internal transformation toward 
becoming a more gender-equal institution. Continued 
integration of gender equality across the agency and 
its programmes requires dedicated attention and 
resources to build gender capacity; to embed gender 
expertise; to collect and analyse data in ways that 
improve the understanding and tracking of gender 
dimensions; and to increase understanding of the 
importance of gender equality across all goal areas  
at UNICEF. 

Our culture and the ways in which UNICEF works, 
including our processes and procedures, must exemplify 
the principles we envision and for which we strive. 

We thus commit to being a gender-transformative 
organization that invests the appropriate 
resources in developing the capacity of staff, 
and that invests in partners and programmes to 
deliver more gender-equitable results, as well as 
in organizational structures and processes that 
hold us accountable to our commitments. 

A gender-transformative UNICEF requires:
Zero tolerance within our organization and amongst 
our partners for discrimination, sexual exploitation, 
abuse, and harassment. This includes a responsibility 
to promote child safeguarding, to create and maintain 
an environment that prevents exploitation and abuse, 
and to provide timely, confidential, and effective 
investigation, assistance, and support to survivors; 

Ending discrimination for all as the responsibility 
of everyone at UNICEF, regardless of their role, 
title, or position, as well as the active participation 
of everyone at UNICEF in eliminating internalized 
gender bias and in promoting gender equality and 
the empowerment of girls and women;

Accountability for results at the highest levels, including 
explicit compliance mechanisms for senior managers 
across the agency on gender equality priorities and 
results, dedicated annual reporting to the Executive 
Board and UN-SWAP, and mechanisms at global, 
regional, and country levels to oversee implementation; 

Achieving parity at all levels, including through 
addressing barriers to recruitment, retention, and 
career mobility for female staff and ensuring equal 
career opportunities for women, men, and persons 
of all genders in UNICEF;

This Gender Policy 
embeds gender equality as 
an essential element of the 
mandate of UNICEF to promote 
the realization of equal 
rights for all children.

Allocating sufficient human and financial resources 
for programming, advocacy, communications, 
learning, and management that connect to gender 
results, including available and adequately funded 
technical expertise to guide the organization’s global 
gender equality efforts;

Attaining the highest level of financial accountability 
to meet our commitments, with ongoing monitoring 
to ensure that minimum standards are consistently 
exceeded, above and beyond benchmarks provided 
by the UN-SWAP;

Working in partnership across sectors to apply 

gender-equitable values and practices, both to 
UNICEF-led programmes and to our work with 
governments, other multilateral agencies, funders, 
and other partners;

Establishing standards that provide sufficient 
support and resources to expand core gender-
technical expertise, not only to provide institutional 
guidance, but also to support and advocate with our 
partners to advance in their own journeys towards 
gender equality; 

Continual organizational learning and growth 
through regularly commissioned independent 
evaluations of our work on gender equality, as well 
as investment in a robust and rigorous research 
agenda that informs and promotes innovative and 
evidence-based programming priorities, policy 
change, and practices, and that contributes to the 
global marketplace of ideas. 

This Gender Policy embeds gender equality as an 
essential element of the mandate of UNICEF to 
promote the realization of equal rights for all children. 
In tandem with the Gender Action Plan, it provides a 
framework and roadmap for UNICEF to operationalize 
these principles to deliver real and lasting results for all 
children, adolescents, and women.
