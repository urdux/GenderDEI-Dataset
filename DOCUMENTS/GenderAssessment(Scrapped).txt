April 20, 2022  The gender analysis reveals the widening discrepanc y between 
men and women in a number of sectors, as well as th e difficulties 
Pakistan confronts in addressing these issues. Ther e are only a 
few data points available on gender gaps in specifi c areas like 
educational success, health, and political engageme nt that could 
be used to help us reach this goal. A lack of resou rces and 
opportunities, as well as a scarcity of knowledge a nd 
information, exacerbate the gender gap. In terms of  political 
engagement, educational attainment, and economic pr oduction, 
the study looks at Pakistan's gender disparities. W e gathered 
data from a range of government, foreign developmen t, and local 
non-governmental organizations for this study. Base d on the 
findings of a gender assessment, a variety of techn iques and 
policies can be implemented to address gender issue s. 
Government education spending should prioritize gen der 
equality while identifying places where there is a greater gender 
divide. Increased government spending on education and 
political engagement will have a huge positive impa ct on rural 
women. Keywords:

Introduction 
In our world, men and women have equal rights, oppo rtunities, and 
responsibilities. Pakistan has the highest level of  gender inequality in the world, 
which is visible in every aspect of life. On the 20 17 Gender Inequality Index, Pakistan 
is placed 133rd out of 160 nations, with a GII valu e of 0.541, indicating that Pakistan 
has the world's highest level of gender inequality (UNDP, 2018). Although boys get 
the bulk of household health and education resource s, there are substantial gender 
discrepancies at the home, market, and institutiona l levels. Women in Pakistan 
confront a shortage of employment options, particul arly in the informal sector2, due 
to poor school enrolment and literacy rates. When w omen's health is ignored, their 
death and life expectancy rates are greater. (Mohey uddin, Ghulam, 2005). All of 
society's traditions practices and cultural standar ds contribute to the discrepancies 
between men and women. Lack of resources, bad healt h, and illiteracy all affect 
women's quality of life, contributing to economic s tagnation (Moheyuddin, Ghulam, 
2005). 
 
Gender Inequality in Pakistan: An Assessment   
Men and women differ significantly in a range of ca tegories, including 
education, work, and health, according to Pakistan' s gender assessment. Because 
current data only show gender inequality in a few p articular categories, such as 
education, health, politics, and labour force parti cipation, achieving this goal will 
necessitate a thorough investigation of both econom ic and non-economic issues. Due 
to a lack of resources and opportunities, movement constraints, a lack of education, 
and a lack of information, women may face various g ender disadvantages (Murad, 
Ahmad Raza & Hasan Sohaib, 2010). As a result of so cial and cultural restraints, 
women face greater challenges in getting these reso urces, which must be overcome 
by coordinated efforts (Bari, 2000). Gender equalit y calls for a long-term cultural 
transition, which can be achieved through education  and increased awareness. As 
society's opinion of women shifts, so will women's role in society. Gender-blind 
policies are tolerated by women, notwithstanding th eir limited impact on 
macroeconomics and social policy (Bari, 2000). Is a  patriarchal society and political 
framework the cause of gender inequality? Women's e xclusion from decision-making 
processes also limits their ability to speak up or express an opinion on municipal, 
regional, and national governance. In comparison to  other South Asian countries, 
Pakistan has a larger proportion of female politici ans4. Pakistani society is completely 
male-dominated and regimented, with men and women p laying defined roles. (B Bari 
F, 2000). In health care, education, and home decis ion-making, women's limited 
mobility and economic dependency play a role. Femal es are more likely to engage in 
home-based economic activities to generate money in  the informal sector since they 
are seen as a source of pride for men. 
Women will be able to recognise their fundamental r ights and the vital role 
they play in society and the economy as a result of  gender equality. Women's 
participation in decision-making will have a positi ve impact on their lives as well as 
on society as a whole. Women can contribute to the well-being of their families if they 
are allowed to participate in economic endeavors. F emales in Pakistan, particularly 
in rural regions, are discouraged from pursuing hig her education by their families. 
As a result of their high school graduation, their enrolment rate lowers. Women's life 
expectancy increased from 65 to 67 years after the birth of their first child. While the 
non-agricultural industry employs 14.5 percent, of women on average, the agriculture 
sector employs 73.2 percent of women, which is exce ptionally high. Until 2017, 
women accounted for 20% of the legislature, accordi ng to sources. 
A new emphasis on gender studies has emerged in the  social sciences. The 
impact of feminist theory on our understanding of h ow men and women are 
perceived, treated, and treated differently in soci ety has been enormous (World Bank, 
2005: Anaya Roy, 2003). Uneven power distribution b etween men and women is a 
global social issue, albeit it is characterized dif ferently depending on the context 
(Nelson, Robert L., 1999). Gender inequality is vis ible even in developed industrial 
countries, where female participation is lower and male unemployment is higher 
(Rives : Janet M : Yousefi, Mahmood, 1997). 
Literature Review 
Given the widespread occurrence of gender-based vio lence in everyday life, 
providing empirical and theoretical grounds for GBV  in catastrophes is crucial. 
Women are more vulnerable to disasters than men aro und the world (Samir 
Dasgupta; Ismail Siriner; Partha Sarathi De, 2010; Eric Neumayer & Thomas Plümper, 
2007; Brenda D. Phillips; Deborah S.K. Thomas; Alic e Fothergill; Lynn Blinn-Pike, 
 
Pakistan Social Sciences Review (PSSR) April-June, 2022 Volume 6, Issue 2 
2009), and women in developing countries die from d isasters at a higher rate than 
men (Domeisen, 1998; Eric Neumayer & Thomas Plümper ). There has been a 
recurring pattern in the number of people killed or  injured in natural disasters, such 
as tsunamis, earthquakes, and hurricanes, since the  early twenty-first century 
(Deborah S.K. Thomas; Brenda D. Phillips; Alice Fot hergill; Lynn Blinn-Pike, 2010). 
As a result, in most locations, women are more resp onsible for child care than men 
and are more likely to work from home than men.  
Natural disasters obstruct pregnant and postpartum women's ability to 
migrate. Women are more vulnerable to disasters tha n men since they live longer than 
males. As a result, women are more likely than men to be the victims of gender-based 
violence (Henrici, J. M; Helmuth, A. S; & Braun, J. , 2010). During times of hardship, 
women are taught to prioritize their own needs, eve n if it means being abused by 
men. (Parkinson, D., 2017)."Essentialist conception s about gender identity, the 
division labor, and masculine power and authority w ere not questioned but were 
protected," according to Enarson and Scanlon (1999,  p. 118). This is what happens 
with disasters, and it is accentuated. Terry and Th omas (1997) think that all members 
of society, regardless of gender, should have equal  access to higher education 
possibilities. 
Gender Inequality and Economic Growth  
Gender inequality has been the subject of numerous research to establish the 
causes, repercussions, and impacts. Theoretical and  empirical causes of economic 
growth are of interest to a large number of economi sts Endogenous growth (growth 
that is not constrained by diminishing capital retu rns) is favoured by some theories 
(Roemer, 1986; R. Lucas, 1988; Chen, Been-Lon, 1997 ) Unlike Solow's (1956) model, 
which includes exogenous savings and population inc rease, this model combines a 
neoclassical production function with exogenous sav ings and population growth to 
show per capita income convergence. Solow's paradig m is diametrically opposite to 
these two models (R. Solow, 1956). A variety of gro wth models emphasize human 
capital. The basic Solow model can still produce co nditional convergence when 
human capital is factored in. It can be used in end ogenous models as well. According 
to a recent study, the reverse is true (Klasen, Ste phan, 2008).  
Gender gaps in schooling have been linked to lower economic growth in a 
number of recent studies. Gender inequality has bee n proven to have a negative 
impact on economic growth in a number of theoretica l contributions. Due to the effect 
of female education on fertility and the developmen t of human capital for the next 
generation, the research implies that eliminating t he gender disparity will result in 
economic growth. These impacts have also been studi ed empirically. In contrast to 
prior research that claimed that gender disparities  in education could boost economic 
growth, it appears that the opposite is true. 
Gender Assessment in Education 
As a result of the country's social, cultural, demo graphic, and economic 
challenges, Pakistan continues to have a gender edu cation gap. Women confront 
prejudice in practically every aspect of life in Pa kistani society, which is patriarchal. 
Gender disparities in education can be measured in a number of ways. When income 
quartiles are taken into account, gender inequaliti es in gross and net enrolment rates 
are obvious. Gender gaps in educational attainment can also be identified using 

Gender Inequality in Pakistan: An Assessment   
graduation and dropout rates. In other words, men p resently outnumber women in 
terms of basic and secondary school attendance and literacy rates, according to the 
Pakistan Economic Survey. Pakistan has made little headway in bridging the 
educational gender gap. According to a 2005 educati on census, there were 2, 27,791 
educational institutions in the country, with 25% d edicated to male students, 21% to 
female students, and 53% coed. The highest levels o f total involvement are in the 
Northwest Frontier Province, Punjab, Sindh, and Nor thwest Frontier Province, while 
the lowest are in Baluchistan. The FATA region of P akistan has the lowest percentage 
of female enrolment, while the Northern Areas and A JK have enrollment rates that 
are approximately comparable. 
Both boys and females have equal access to schoolin g. Discrimination based 
on race, ethnicity, or gender is prohibited. Articl e 25A of Pakistan's constitution 
mandates that all citizens, regardless of gender, r eceive free and compulsory 
education. Educational inequality is at the root of  a slew of other socioeconomic 
issues. This is especially true for girls, who face  a higher rate of gender discrimination 
in schools than their urban counterparts, due to im poverished families' lack of 
financial resources to provide a better education f or their children. A paucity of 
female teachers in rural areas, a lack of vital sch ool infrastructures like water, power, 
a boundary wall, and political activity in rural co mmunities are all factors that 
contribute to the low percentage of female pupils i n schools. A lack of public money 
is another key impediment to educational growth. 
The educational system in Baluchistan is less devel oped than in Punjab, 
making it more difficult for girls to avoid going t o school14. In both rural and urban 
areas, female attendance in public schools is mostl y a result of these institutions' poor 
conditions, which include antiquated structures, a scarcity of educated teachers, and 
a low level of education. Separation based on race,  class, and socioeconomic standing 
is another factor that contributes to the widening of social divides in our educational 
system.

and Discussion of this research article.  
Gender Assessment in Political Participation 
As a result of the Local Governor Ordinance of 2001 , women now have more 
opportunities to engage in the country's political process. Nearly 36,000 women voted 
in the 2001 election, the majority of them had no p rior experience in government. 
They were both unsure of their fundamental rights, obligations, and responsibilities. 
Women, on the other hand, must be included in polit ics if they are to have a voice. 
The National Assembly has 342 members, 60 of whom a re women and ten of whom 
are non-Muslims, according to Article 51. Seats are  also distributed depending on 
population across states, federally administered tr ibal areas (FATA), and the nation's 
capital. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has Pa kistan rated 100th, ahead of 
countries like India. According to Article 50 of th e 1973 Constitution, Pakistan's 
Parliament is bicameral. The National Assembly and the Senate, as well as a 
President, make up the government. 
Following modifications to the constitution and the  Proclamation of Local 
Government Ordinance, 2000, the Pakistani governmen t ensured that a minimum of 
33 percent of local government seats were reserved for women. Female legislators 
presently hold 128 seats in provincial legislatures  and 17% of National Assembly 
seats. Women have been allotted 60 seats in the Nat ional Assembly, accounting for 
17% of total seats, according to the latest recent figures. Punjab has 35 female seats 
out of a total of 148 in Pakistan's most populated province.

Material and Methods 
Secondary sources and publicly available data are u sed in this investigation. 
Secondary data is data obtained from original sourc es and made available to 
academics for use in their own study. To put it ano ther way, this is data that has 
already been collected. You may have obtained data for one reason as a researcher 
and then shared it with another to perform another study. Data that has been reused 
is referred to as secondary data in the original st udy and main data in the follow-up 
study. Publications such as books, journals, newspa pers, and websites, as well as 
other publicly available documents, will be used as  secondary data sources in 2021 
(Formplus, 2021). Secondary qualitative data analys is is used to answer questions 
about the research that were not addressed in the i nitial study (Hinds et, 1997). 
Making primary datasets available for secondary stu dy on their own can be 
advantageous for new researchers. Qualitative resea rchers examine data to gain a 
more comprehensive picture of a phenomenon. 

 
Gender Inequality in Pakistan: An Assessment 
 

The study looks into the inequalities between men a nd women in terms of 
political activity and health in Pakistan. The stud y incorporates both qualitative and 
quantitative data from government, international de velopment, and local non-profit 
organization publications. This examination clarifi es gender roles, relationships, and 
resource control between the sexes in order to full y exploit the potential and 
restrictions of economic and human advancement. 
Results and Discussions  
Table 1 depicts the gender difference in Pakistani education from 2003 to 2017. 
Male literacy stands at 81 percent, compared to 66 percent for females, despite the fact 
that the young adult literacy rate (15-24) has incr eased over time. The ratio of primary 
and secondary problems in boys and females follows a similar trend. Both ratios have 
improved in recent years, but the Secondary Complet ion Rate for both genders has to 
be improved urgently. In 2017, 55 percent of males and less than half of girls had 
completed secondary education. Males are more likel y than females to make the 
transition from primary to secondary education. At least 88 percent of boys and 78 
percent of girls completed the transition from elem entary to secondary general 
education in 2016. Males, on the other hand, saw a 5% increase in their rate of 
transition between 2004 and 2017, while females saw  a 5% increase. Nonetheless, the 
proportion of children over the age of six who did not complete primary school 
decreased for both genders between 2004 and 2017. A t least 50 million girls and 34 
million boys were unable to attend school in 2003; however, these figures began to 
fall after that. Despite the fact that 32 million g irls and 21 million boys did not attend 
school in 2017, the gender gap in those who did not  attend school is larger than the 
gap in those who did not attend school among men, n eeding further attention. 
According to the Global Campaign for Education, 5.1  million primary school 
children, 63% of whom are female, do not go to scho ol (2014). This country has the 
world's third-highest school absence percentage amo ng school-aged youngsters. In 
addition, due to gender gaps in educational attainm ent, Pakistan is ranked 147th out 
of 189 countries on the Gender Inequality Index.  
Table 3 of the Gender Parity Index (GPI) shows this  educational disparity (see 
below). According to GPI data from 2003, the GPI va lue was 0.77, but by 2016 it had 
risen to 0.81. The gender gap, though, is still les s than one. According to women's and 
children's rights treaties, 77 million youngsters, 56 percent of whom are females, are 
unable to exercise their fundamental educational ri ghts (CRC). Women in Pakistan 
face more bias in education than men, as these figu res show. Poverty, cultural norms, 
travel restrictions, a lack of educational faciliti es, a shortage of female educators, and 
inadequate government support for education are jus t a few of the obstacles women 
encounter on their path to a better future.

From 1999-2000 to 2015-16, additional indices of ed ucational gender 
imbalance, such as the number of schools, students,  instructors, and student-teacher 
ratios, are included below. In 1999-2000, female st udents occupied nearly half of all 
elementary schools (58 percent of total enrolment),  nearly all middle schools (8.1 
percent), and nearly all high schools (98 percent) (4.6 percent). As a result, while the 
total number of primary, middle and high schools de creased, the total number of 
female schools increased across the board, with 60. 1, 21.3, and 13.8 thousand female 
schools in primary, middle, and high schools, respe ctively. In every category, male 
and female enrolment has gradually climbed over the  last fifteen years. There is, 
however, a large gender gap. Males made up 70.4 per cent of primary, 161.5 percent 
of the middle, and 141.8 percent of secondary schoo l enrolments in 1990-00, while 
females made up 52.2 percent of high school enrolme nts. 
Having said that, we are starting to see a rise in political engagement. Table 4 
represents the distribution of National Assembly se ats in Pakistan in 2019 based on 
the most recent information available on the Nation al Assembly's website. The 
seating arrangement may be changed from its initial  form if no oath is taken or if seats 
remain vacant. The National Assembly has a 22.5 per cent female presence, but Punjab 
has a higher female representation than the other p rovinces.

eliminated. The number of female seats in the Natio nal Assembly and Senate was 
drastically increased in 2002, to a total of 22. Ac cording to the Senate of Pakistan's 
website, women held 16.346 percent of Senate seats in 2018, but the Constitution of 
the Eighteenth Amendment Act, 2010, added four seat s for non-Muslim senators. 
Only one female senator served in the United States  Senate in 1990, which was 
considered extremely unusual at the time. There wer e 17 women on the board by 
1993. Female representation in the representative b ody has also been raised. Women 
made up 20% of the Senate's 104 members in 2018. Pa kistan has an increasing number 
of women participating in the political process as voters, candidates, or political 
activists compared to other countries, including th e most democratic. Women should 
have more opportunities to hold national leadership  positions so that they may push 
for policies that benefit women from all walks of l ife. 
Conclusion 
This study examines gender inequality in Pakistan, focusing on variations in 
educational achievement and political involvement a mong women. Gender 
discrepancies have been observed more frequently in  females than in males, implying 
that female positions are not regarded as equal to male positions. As a result, 
economic development will not be able to realize it s full potential unless gender is 
taken into account. Men’s and women's gender roles differ substantially depending 
on socioeconomic and cultural factors. Patriarchal ideas have also shaped women's 
responsibilities in society. As a result of traditi onal social standards that artificially 
segregate production and reproduction, women have b een relegated to the 
reproductive roles of mothers and spouses. Accordin g to figures from both 
government and non-government sources, Pakistan's g ender gap is showing a mixed 
trend. The results of a gender assessment can be us ed in strategic planning, policy 
creation, or mission formulation to counteract gend er inequity. Equal access to 
education, political participation, and economic en gagement for men and women is 
required, as well as equal decision-making authorit y for women. 
Female senior management representation, on the oth er hand, is extremely 
low, owing to the female workforce's lack of educat ion and competencies. When it 
comes to female managers, Pakistan is ranked 108th in the globe (ILO, 2015). To begin, 
reducing the income disparity between men and women  will necessitate increasing 
women's educational opportunities. Women's educatio n can be used to expand 
women's employment opportunities in the formal sect or, hence reducing gender 
inequality. To eliminate gender stereotypes, the fe deral and provincial governments 
should prioritize female education. 
Recommendations 
 Improved financial infrastructure and access to int erest-free loans are 
essential for women entrepreneurs and students to b e economically 
empowered.  
 It is vital to educate women about their civic righ ts in order to inspire more 
women to enter politics. To elect leaders who will seek to improve women's 
lives in the future, the government should raise aw areness of the fact that all 
women have the right to vote, particularly in rural  areas. Pakistan has enacted 
legislation and implemented programs to promote wom en's rights and 
gender equality. National plans of action and the N ational Policy for Women's

 Development and Empowerment both have the goal of e mpowering women 
and ensuring equal access to all services (2002, re spectively).  
 The federal and provincial governments' 2005 Gender  Reform Action Plan 
(GRAP) displays their commitment to reducing gender  inequity. Political 
engagement, institutional restructuring, public sec tor employment, policy, 
budgeting, and public expenditure procedures, as we ll as capacity-building 
initiatives, are all mandated by GRAP, with a speci al emphasis on gender 
mainstreaming.

The gender analysis reveals the widening discrepancy between 
men and women in a number of sectors, as well as the difficulties 
Pakistan confronts in addressing these issues. There are only a 
few  data  points  available  on  gender  gaps  in  specific  areas  like 
educational success, health, and political engagement that could 
be  used  to  help  us  reach  this  goal.  A  lack  of  resources  and 
opportunities,  as  well  as  a  scarcity  of  knowledge  and 
information,  exacerbate  the  gender  gap.  In  terms  of  political 
engagement, educational attainment, and economic production, 
the  study  looks  at  Pakistan's  gender  disparities.  We  gathered 
data from a range of government, foreign development, and local 
non-governmental  organizations  for  this  study.  Based  on  the 
findings  of  a  gender  assessment,  a  variety  of  techniques  and 
policies  can  be 
issues. 
Government  education  spending  should  prioritize  gender 
equality while identifying places where there is a greater gender 
divide.  Increased  government  spending  on  education  and 
political engagement will have a huge positive impact on rural 
women.

Introduction 

In  our  world,  men  and  women  have  equal  rights,  opportunities,  and 
responsibilities.  Pakistan  has  the  highest  level  of  gender  inequality  in  the  world, 
which is visible in every aspect of life. On the 2017 Gender Inequality Index, Pakistan 
is placed 133rd out of 160 nations, with a GII value of 0.541, indicating that Pakistan 
has the world's highest level of gender inequality (UNDP, 2018). Although boys get 
the bulk of household health and education resources, there are substantial gender 
discrepancies  at  the  home,  market,  and  institutional  levels.  Women  in  Pakistan 
confront a shortage of employment options, particularly in the informal sector2, due 
to poor school enrolment and literacy rates. When women's health is ignored, their 
death  and  life  expectancy  rates  are  greater.  (Moheyuddin,  Ghulam,  2005).  All  of 
society's  traditions  practices and  cultural  standards  contribute  to  the  discrepancies 
between  men  and  women.  Lack  of  resources,  bad  health,  and  illiteracy  all  affect 
women's quality of life, contributing to economic stagnation (Moheyuddin, Ghulam, 
2005). 

Men  and  women  differ  significantly  in  a  range  of  categories,  including 
education,  work,  and  health,  according  to  Pakistan's  gender  assessment.  Because 
current  data  only  show  gender  inequality  in  a  few  particular  categories,  such  as 
education,  health,  politics,  and  labour  force  participation,  achieving  this  goal  will 
necessitate a thorough investigation of both economic and non-economic issues. Due 
to a lack of resources and opportunities, movement constraints, a lack of education, 
and a lack of information, women may face various gender disadvantages (Murad, 
Ahmad  Raza  &  Hasan  Sohaib,  2010).  As  a  result  of  social  and  cultural  restraints, 
women face greater challenges in getting these resources, which must be overcome 
by  coordinated  efforts  (Bari,  2000).  Gender  equality  calls  for  a  long-term  cultural 
transition,  which  can  be  achieved  through  education  and  increased  awareness.  As 
society's  opinion  of  women  shifts,  so  will  women's  role  in  society.  Gender-blind 
policies  are  tolerated  by  women,  notwithstanding  their  limited  impact  on 
macroeconomics and social policy (Bari, 2000). Is a patriarchal society and political 
framework the cause of gender inequality? Women's exclusion from decision-making 
processes  also  limits  their  ability  to  speak  up  or  express  an  opinion  on  municipal, 
regional,  and  national  governance.  In  comparison  to  other  South  Asian  countries, 
Pakistan has a larger proportion of female politicians4. Pakistani society is completely 
male-dominated and regimented, with men and women playing defined roles. (B Bari 
F,  2000).  In  health  care,  education,  and  home  decision-making,  women's  limited 
mobility and economic dependency play a role. Females are more likely to engage in 
home-based economic activities to generate money in the informal sector since they 
are seen as a source of pride for men. 

Women will be able to recognise their fundamental rights and the vital role 
they  play  in  society  and  the  economy  as  a  result  of  gender  equality.  Women's 
participation in decision-making will have a positive impact on their lives as well as 
on society as a whole. Women can contribute to the well-being of their families if they 
are allowed to participate in economic endeavors. Females in Pakistan, particularly 
in rural regions, are discouraged from pursuing higher education by their families. 
As a result of their high school graduation, their enrolment rate lowers. Women's life 
expectancy increased from 65 to 67 years after the birth of their first child. While the 
non-agricultural industry employs 14.5 percent, of women on average, the agriculture 
sector  employs  73.2  percent  of  women,  which  is  exceptionally  high.  Until  2017, 
women accounted for 20% of the legislature, according to sources. 

A new emphasis on gender studies has emerged in the social sciences. The 
impact  of  feminist  theory  on  our  understanding  of  how  men  and  women  are 
perceived, treated, and treated differently in society has been enormous (World Bank, 
2005: Anaya Roy, 2003). Uneven power distribution between men and women is a 
global  social  issue,  albeit  it  is  characterized  differently  depending  on  the  context 
(Nelson, Robert L., 1999). Gender inequality is visible even in developed industrial 
countries,  where  female  participation  is  lower  and  male  unemployment  is  higher 
(Rives : Janet M : Yousefi, Mahmood, 1997). 

Literature Review 

Given the widespread occurrence of gender-based violence in everyday life, 
providing  empirical  and  theoretical  grounds  for  GBV  in  catastrophes  is  crucial. 
Women  are  more  vulnerable  to  disasters  than  men  around  the  world  (Samir 
Dasgupta; Ismail Siriner; Partha Sarathi De, 2010; Eric Neumayer & Thomas Plümper, 
2007;  Brenda  D.  Phillips;  Deborah  S.K.  Thomas;  Alice  Fothergill;  Lynn  Blinn-Pike,  
 
Pakistan Social Sciences Review (PSSR) 

April-June, 2022 Volume 6, Issue 2 

2009), and women in developing countries die from disasters at a higher rate than 
men  (Domeisen,  1998;  Eric  Neumayer  &  Thomas  Plümper).  There  has  been  a 
recurring pattern in the number of people killed or injured in natural disasters, such 
as  tsunamis,  earthquakes,  and  hurricanes,  since  the  early  twenty-first  century 
(Deborah S.K. Thomas; Brenda D. Phillips; Alice Fothergill; Lynn Blinn-Pike, 2010). 
As a result, in most locations, women are more responsible for child care than men 
and are more likely to work from home than men.  

Natural  disasters  obstruct  pregnant  and  postpartum  women's  ability  to 
migrate. Women are more vulnerable to disasters than men since they live longer than 
males. As a result, women are more likely than men to be the victims of gender-based 
violence (Henrici, J. M; Helmuth, A. S; & Braun, J., 2010). During times of hardship, 
women  are  taught  to  prioritize their  own needs,  even  if  it  means being abused  by 
men.  (Parkinson,  D.,  2017)."Essentialist  conceptions  about  gender  identity,  the 
division  labor,  and  masculine  power  and  authority  were  not  questioned  but  were 
protected,"  according  to  Enarson  and  Scanlon  (1999,  p.  118).  This  is what  happens 
with disasters, and it is accentuated. Terry and Thomas (1997) think that all members 
of  society,  regardless  of  gender,  should  have  equal  access  to  higher  education 
possibilities. 

Gender Inequality and Economic Growth 

Gender inequality has been the subject of numerous research to establish the 
causes,  repercussions,  and  impacts.  Theoretical  and  empirical  causes  of  economic 
growth are of interest to a large number of economists Endogenous growth (growth 
that is not constrained by diminishing capital returns) is favoured by some theories 
(Roemer, 1986; R. Lucas, 1988; Chen, Been-Lon, 1997) Unlike Solow's (1956) model, 
which includes exogenous savings and population increase, this model combines a 
neoclassical production function with exogenous savings and population growth to 
show per capita income convergence. Solow's paradigm is diametrically opposite to 
these two models (R. Solow, 1956). A variety of growth models emphasize human 
capital.  The  basic  Solow  model  can  still  produce  conditional  convergence  when 
human capital is factored in. It can be used in endogenous models as well. According 
to a recent study, the reverse is true (Klasen, Stephan, 2008). 

Gender  gaps in  schooling  have been  linked  to  lower  economic  growth  in  a 
number  of  recent  studies.  Gender  inequality  has  been  proven  to  have  a  negative 
impact on economic growth in a number of theoretical contributions. Due to the effect 
of female education on fertility and the development of human capital for the next 
generation, the research implies that eliminating the gender disparity will result in 
economic growth. These impacts have also been studied empirically. In contrast to 
prior research that claimed that gender disparities in education could boost economic 
growth, it appears that the opposite is true. 

Gender Assessment in Education 

As  a  result  of  the  country's  social,  cultural,  demographic,  and  economic 
challenges,  Pakistan  continues  to  have  a  gender  education  gap.  Women  confront 
prejudice in practically every aspect of life in Pakistani society, which is patriarchal. 
Gender disparities in education can be measured in a number of ways. When income 
quartiles are taken into account, gender inequalities in gross and net enrolment rates 
are  obvious.  Gender  gaps  in  educational  attainment  can  also  be  identified  using 

graduation and dropout rates. In other words, men presently outnumber women in 
terms of basic and secondary school attendance and literacy rates, according to the 
Pakistan  Economic  Survey.  Pakistan  has  made  little  headway  in  bridging  the 
educational gender gap. According to a 2005 education census, there were 2, 27,791 
educational institutions in the country, with 25% dedicated to male students, 21% to 
female  students,  and  53%  coed.  The  highest  levels  of  total  involvement  are  in  the 
Northwest Frontier Province, Punjab, Sindh, and Northwest Frontier Province, while 
the lowest are in Baluchistan. The FATA region of Pakistan has the lowest percentage 
of female enrolment, while the Northern Areas and AJK have enrollment rates that 
are approximately comparable. 

Both boys and females have equal access to schooling. Discrimination based 
on  race,  ethnicity,  or  gender  is  prohibited.  Article  25A  of  Pakistan's  constitution 
mandates  that  all  citizens,  regardless  of  gender,  receive  free  and  compulsory 
education.  Educational  inequality  is  at  the  root  of  a  slew  of  other  socioeconomic 
issues. This is especially true for girls, who face a higher rate of gender discrimination 
in  schools  than  their  urban  counterparts,  due  to  impoverished  families'  lack  of 
financial  resources  to  provide  a  better  education  for  their  children.  A  paucity  of 
female teachers in rural areas, a lack of vital school infrastructures like water, power, 
a  boundary  wall,  and  political  activity  in  rural  communities  are  all  factors  that 
contribute to the low percentage of female pupils in schools. A lack of public money 
is another key impediment to educational growth. 

The  educational  system  in  Baluchistan  is  less  developed  than  in  Punjab, 
making it more difficult for girls to avoid going to school14. In both rural and urban 
areas, female attendance in public schools is mostly a result of these institutions' poor 
conditions, which include antiquated structures, a scarcity of educated teachers, and 
a low level of education. Separation based on race, class, and socioeconomic standing 
is another factor that contributes to the widening of social divides in our educational 
system.

and Discussion of this research article.  

Gender Assessment in Political Participation 

As a result of the Local Governor Ordinance of 2001, women now have more 
opportunities to engage in the country's political process. Nearly 36,000 women voted 
in  the  2001  election,  the  majority  of  them  had  no  prior  experience  in  government. 
They were both unsure of their fundamental rights, obligations, and responsibilities. 
Women, on the other hand, must be included in politics if they are to have a voice. 
The National Assembly has 342 members, 60 of whom are women and ten of whom 
are  non-Muslims,  according  to  Article  51.  Seats  are  also  distributed  depending  on 
population across states, federally administered tribal areas (FATA), and the nation's 
capital.  The  Inter-Parliamentary  Union  (IPU)  has  Pakistan  rated  100th,  ahead  of 
countries  like  India.  According  to  Article  50  of  the  1973  Constitution,  Pakistan's 
Parliament  is  bicameral.  The  National  Assembly  and  the  Senate,  as  well  as  a 
President, make up the government. 

Following  modifications  to  the  constitution  and  the  Proclamation  of  Local 
Government Ordinance, 2000, the Pakistani government ensured that a minimum of 
33  percent  of  local  government  seats  were  reserved  for  women.  Female legislators 
presently  hold  128  seats  in  provincial  legislatures  and  17%  of  National  Assembly 
seats. Women have been allotted 60 seats in the National Assembly, accounting for 
17% of total seats, according to the latest recent figures. Punjab has 35 female seats 
out of a total of 148 in Pakistan's most populated province. 

Secondary sources and publicly available data are used in this investigation. 
Secondary  data  is  data  obtained  from  original  sources  and  made  available  to 
academics  for  use  in  their  own  study.  To  put  it  another  way,  this  is  data  that  has 
already been collected. You may have obtained data for one reason as a researcher 
and then shared it with another to perform another study. Data that has been reused 
is referred to as secondary data in the original study and main data in the follow-up 
study.  Publications  such  as  books,  journals,  newspapers,  and  websites,  as  well  as 
other publicly available documents, will be used as secondary data sources in 2021 
(Formplus,  2021).  Secondary  qualitative  data  analysis  is  used  to  answer  questions 
about  the  research  that  were  not  addressed  in  the  initial  study  (Hinds  et,  1997). 
Making  primary  datasets  available  for  secondary  study  on  their  own  can  be 
advantageous  for  new  researchers.  Qualitative  researchers  examine  data  to  gain  a 
more comprehensive picture of a phenomenon. 


The  study  looks  into  the  inequalities  between  men  and women  in  terms  of 
political activity and health in Pakistan. The study incorporates both qualitative and 
quantitative data from government, international development, and local non-profit 
organization publications. This examination clarifies gender roles, relationships, and 
resource  control  between  the  sexes  in  order  to  fully  exploit  the  potential  and 
restrictions of economic and human advancement. 

Results and Discussions 

Table 1 depicts the gender difference in Pakistani education from 2003 to 2017. 
Male literacy stands at 81 percent, compared to 66 percent for females, despite the fact 
that the young adult literacy rate (15-24) has increased over time. The ratio of primary 
and secondary problems in boys and females follows a similar trend. Both ratios have 
improved in recent years, but the Secondary Completion Rate for both genders has to 
be  improved  urgently.  In  2017,  55  percent  of  males  and  less  than  half  of  girls  had 
completed  secondary  education.  Males  are  more  likely  than  females  to  make  the 
transition from primary to secondary education. At least 88 percent of boys and 78 
percent  of  girls  completed  the  transition  from  elementary  to  secondary  general 
education  in  2016.  Males,  on  the  other  hand,  saw  a  5%  increase  in  their  rate  of 
transition between 2004 and 2017, while females saw a 5% increase. Nonetheless, the 
proportion  of  children  over  the  age  of  six  who  did  not  complete  primary  school 
decreased for both genders between 2004 and 2017. At least 50 million girls and 34 
million boys were unable to attend school in 2003; however, these figures began to 
fall after that. Despite the fact that 32 million girls and 21 million boys did not attend 
school in 2017, the gender gap in those who did not attend school is larger than the 
gap  in  those  who  did  not  attend  school  among  men,  needing  further  attention. 
According  to  the  Global  Campaign  for  Education,  5.1  million  primary  school 
children, 63% of whom are female, do not go to school (2014). This country has the 
world's third-highest school absence percentage among school-aged youngsters. In 
addition, due to gender gaps in educational attainment, Pakistan is ranked 147th out 
of 189 countries on the Gender Inequality Index.  

Table 3 of the Gender Parity Index (GPI) shows this educational disparity (see 
below). According to GPI data from 2003, the GPI value was 0.77, but by 2016 it had 
risen to 0.81. The gender gap, though, is still less than one. According to women's and 
children's rights treaties, 77 million youngsters, 56 percent of whom are females, are 
unable to exercise their fundamental educational rights (CRC). Women in Pakistan 
face more bias in education than men, as these figures show. Poverty, cultural norms, 
travel restrictions, a lack of educational facilities, a shortage of female educators, and 
inadequate government support for education are just a few of the obstacles women 
encounter on their path to a better future. 


From  1999-2000  to  2015-16,  additional  indices  of  educational  gender 
imbalance, such as the number of schools, students, instructors, and student-teacher 
ratios, are included below. In 1999-2000, female students occupied nearly half of all 
elementary  schools  (58  percent  of  total  enrolment),  nearly  all  middle  schools  (8.1 
percent), and nearly all high schools (98 percent) (4.6 percent). As a result, while the 
total  number  of  primary,  middle  and  high  schools  decreased,  the  total  number  of 
female schools increased across the board, with 60.1, 21.3, and 13.8 thousand female 
schools in primary, middle, and high schools, respectively. In every category, male 
and  female  enrolment  has  gradually  climbed  over  the  last  fifteen  years.  There  is, 
however, a large gender gap. Males made up 70.4 percent of primary, 161.5 percent 
of  the  middle,  and 141.8  percent  of secondary  school  enrolments in  1990-00, while 
females made up 52.2 percent of high school enrolments. 

Having said that, we are starting to see a rise in political engagement. Table 4 
represents the distribution of National Assembly seats in Pakistan in 2019 based on 
the  most  recent  information  available  on  the  National  Assembly's  website.  The 
seating arrangement may be changed from its initial form if no oath is taken or if seats 
remain vacant. The National Assembly has a 22.5 percent female presence, but Punjab 
has a higher female representation than the other provinces. 
Female  representation  in  the  National  Assembly  is  extremely  low,  both 
among  Muslim  and non-Muslim  members.  In  1990,  there  were  215  male members 
and 2 female members in the National Assembly, a male-to-female ratio of less than 
0.9 percent. Between 1993 and 1997, however, the number progressively increased. 
During  the  general  elections  of  1988,  1990,  and  2007,  female-only  seats  were 

Gender Inequality in Pakistan: An Assessment 

eliminated.  The number  of  female  seats  in  the National Assembly  and Senate  was 
drastically increased in 2002, to a total of 22. According to the Senate of Pakistan's 
website, women held 16.346 percent of Senate seats in 2018, but the Constitution of 
the  Eighteenth  Amendment  Act,  2010,  added  four  seats  for  non-Muslim  senators. 
Only  one  female  senator  served  in  the  United  States  Senate  in  1990,  which  was 
considered  extremely  unusual  at  the  time.  There  were  17  women  on  the  board  by 
1993. Female representation in the representative body has also been raised. Women 
made up 20% of the Senate's 104 members in 2018. Pakistan has an increasing number 
of  women  participating  in  the  political  process  as  voters,  candidates,  or  political 
activists compared to other countries, including the most democratic. Women should 
have more opportunities to hold national leadership positions so that they may push 
for policies that benefit women from all walks of life. 

Conclusion 

This study examines gender inequality in Pakistan, focusing on variations in 
educational  achievement  and  political  involvement  among  women.  Gender 
discrepancies have been observed more frequently in females than in males, implying 
that  female  positions  are  not  regarded  as  equal  to  male  positions.  As  a  result, 
economic development will not be able to realize its full potential unless gender is 
taken into account. Men’s and women's gender roles differ substantially depending 
on socioeconomic and cultural factors. Patriarchal ideas have also shaped women's 
responsibilities in society. As a result of traditional social standards that artificially 
segregate  production  and  reproduction,  women  have  been  relegated  to  the 
reproductive  roles  of  mothers  and  spouses.  According  to  figures  from  both 
government and non-government sources, Pakistan's gender gap is showing a mixed 
trend. The results of a gender assessment can be used in strategic planning, policy 
creation,  or  mission  formulation  to  counteract  gender  inequity.  Equal  access  to 
education, political participation, and economic engagement for men and women is 
required, as well as equal decision-making authority for women. 

Female  senior  management  representation,  on  the  other  hand,  is  extremely 
low, owing to the female workforce's lack of education and competencies. When it 
comes to female managers, Pakistan is ranked 108th in the globe (ILO, 2015). To begin, 
reducing the income disparity between men and women will necessitate increasing 
women's  educational  opportunities.  Women's  education  can  be  used  to  expand 
women's  employment  opportunities  in  the  formal  sector,  hence  reducing  gender 
inequality. To eliminate gender stereotypes, the federal and provincial governments 
should prioritize female education. 

Recommendations 
 
Improved  financial  infrastructure  and  access  to  interest-free  loans  are 
essential  for  women  entrepreneurs  and  students  to  be  economically 
empowered. 

It is vital to educate women about their civic rights in order to inspire more 
women to enter politics. To elect leaders who will seek to improve women's 
lives in the future, the government should raise awareness of the fact that all 
women have the right to vote, particularly in rural areas. Pakistan has enacted 
legislation  and  implemented  programs  to  promote  women's  rights  and 
gender equality. National plans of action and the National Policy for Women's

Development and Empowerment both have the goal of empowering women 
and ensuring equal access to all services (2002, respectively). 

The  federal  and  provincial  governments'  2005  Gender  Reform  Action  Plan 
(GRAP)  displays  their  commitment  to  reducing  gender  inequity.  Political
